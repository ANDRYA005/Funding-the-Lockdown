        <h2 id="NEF">NEF (National Empowerment Fund) </h2>

        <h4>Information</h4>
        <p>The NEF is managing the DTI COVID-19 Relief fund. Offering assistance between R250000-R75million.</p>

        <h4>Requirements (among others)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete business plan and financial projections. Specifically, 3 years audited financials and 5 years financial projections.</li>
