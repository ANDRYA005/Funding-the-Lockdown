        <p>Searching for funding that is accessible to small business entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems that everything (barring the UIF relief) comes in the form of a loan and is only accessible to businesses that are registered and compliant, among other requirements.</p>

        <h2><a id="NEF">NEF (National Empowerment Fund) </a></h2>

        <p>The NEF is managing the DTI COVID-19 Relief fund. The first part of this process is to fill in the NEF application form.
        offering assistance between R250000-R75million.
        Access: The application form comes in electronic format.
        Requirements (among others): Complete business plan and financial projections. Specifically, 3 years audited financials and 5 years financial projections.
        *Note, this application is very in depth and the requirements seem to be for far larger businesses. Essentially, the DTIC fund is for large businesses and it comes in the form of a LOAN (so this is not like grant funding and it will have to be repaid).
        Accessibility for small business entrepreneurs: very poor.
        </p>
