# Funding_the_Lockdown

Website that centralized the funding information for SMMEs during the lockdown in South Africa. The website has been discontinued, but we managed to get 1 600 users over a period of 2 months.

Here is a snapshot of the website:

We decided to leave the website as minimal as possible to save on the data costs which would be incurred otherwise as our target market was SMMEs who are generally lower-income individuals.
